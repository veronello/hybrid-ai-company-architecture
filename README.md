# hybrid-ai-company-architecture
_## About This Project

This repository explores a **transparent, hybrid-entity model** for collaboration between a Germany-based GmbH (or similar EU-based structure) and a US-based partner supported by AI agents.

The goal: to **optimize within international legal frameworks**, ensuring full compliance with tax, data, and AI regulations in both jurisdictions.

### Key Principles

- 💡 **AI tools assist**, but do not replace, human oversight or responsibility.
- 🌍 **International tax compliance** via DE–US Double Taxation Treaty (DBA) and similar treaties.
- 🧾 **GDPR & AI Act alignment** through non-EU-side data handling and automation.
- 🧠 **Scalable, minimal-risk setup** leveraging digital collaboration without regulatory overreach.

### Folder Structure

See `/whitepaper`, `/legal`, and `/diagrams` for architecture and logic references.
