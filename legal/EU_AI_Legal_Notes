# EU AI Legal Notes (Planned)

This file will summarize relevant provisions of:
- The EU AI Act (2024 final version)
- GDPR overlap for AI workflows
- Restrictions on cross-border automated decision-making
- Risk classification models (minimal, limited, high-risk)

Focus: clarify which parts of the AI workflow must remain under EU jurisdiction, and how non-EU digital agents can legally participate without violating Article 5‚Äì11.
